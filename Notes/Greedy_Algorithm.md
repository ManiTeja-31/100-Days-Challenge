### ✅ What is a **Greedy Algorithm**?

A **greedy algorithm** is a problem-solving approach that **makes the locally optimal choice at each step**, hoping that these local choices will lead to a **globally optimal solution**.

At each decision point, the algorithm:

* Chooses the best available option **without reconsidering** previous choices.
* **Doesn’t backtrack**.
* Tries to build up a solution piece by piece.

---

### 📌 Characteristics of Greedy Algorithms

* **Greedy choice property**: A global optimum can be arrived at by selecting a local optimum.
* **Optimal substructure**: The problem can be broken down into subproblems that are similar in structure.

### ✅ Examples of Greedy Algorithms

| Problem                          | Greedy Approach                                         |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Coin Change (Greedy Version)** | Pick the largest denomination coin until amount = 0     |
| **Activity Selection**           | Pick the next activity that ends earliest               |
| **Huffman Coding**               | Merge two lowest frequency nodes repeatedly             |
| **Kruskal’s Algorithm**          | Always pick the smallest edge that doesn’t form a cycle |
| **Prim’s Algorithm**             | Always pick the smallest weight edge from visited set   |
| **Fractional Knapsack**          | Pick items based on highest value/weight ratio          |

### ❌ When Greedy Fails

Greedy doesn’t always work. For example:

#### 🔻 0/1 Knapsack Problem:

* Greedy fails because choosing by value or weight may not lead to the best total value.
* **Dynamic Programming** is required.

#### 🔻 Coin Change (when denominations are unusual):

* Greedy fails for coins like `[1, 3, 4]` when trying to make amount = 6.
* Correct solution: 3+3 (2 coins)
* Greedy might pick 4+1+1 (3 coins)

| -------------------- | ----------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Decision Process     | Locally optimal               | Explore all options using recursion+memo | Try all options with pruning             |
| Re-evaluation        | No                            | Yes (uses past subproblems)              | Yes (backtracks if current path fails)   |
| Optimality Guarantee | Only if Greedy property holds | Always (for overlapping subproblems)     | Yes (if it explores full space)          |
| Complexity           | Usually faster                | Often slower (but optimal)               | Usually slow (exponential in worst case) |

### 🛠️ When to Use Greedy Algorithm?

#### ✅ Use Greedy when:

* Problem has **greedy choice property** and **optimal substructure**
* You're asked to **maximize/minimize something**, like:

  * **Max profit**, **min cost**, **max coverage**
* It’s proven to work for that type of problem (like MST or Fractional Knapsack)

#### ❌ Avoid Greedy when:

* Decisions affect future choices significantly
* Problem requires evaluating multiple past decisions
* You’re solving problems like:

  * **0/1 Knapsack**
  * **Edit Distance**
  * **Matrix Chain Multiplication**

---

### 🧪 How to Identify Greedy Applicability

1. **Try building the solution step by step** using a local choice.

2. **Think of a counter-example**: Can a better global solution exist?

3. Check if the problem is:

   * **Minimize/Maximize** a value?
   * **Resource scheduling**?
   * **Path/Tree building**?

4. Look up if it’s a **known Greedy-solved problem**.

## 🧪 Greedy Algorithm Template

```python
def greedy_solution(data):
    # Step 1: Sort or preprocess
    data.sort(key=custom_logic)

    result = []
    for item in data:
        if is_valid_choice(item, result):
            result.append(item)
    
    return result
```

# Difference Between "Balloons Blast" and "Minimum Number of Platforms Required"

This guide explains **two popular greedy problems** in a **beginner-friendly way** with diagrams, tips, and key differences.

---

## 1. Balloons Blast Problem

### **What is it about?**
You have balloons placed at different positions along a line.  
When you shoot an arrow, it can **burst multiple balloons** if they overlap in range.  
The goal is to **find the minimum number of arrows** needed to burst all balloons.

---

### **ASCII Diagram**

Positions:  1     2     3     4     5     6     7     8     9    10    11    12
Balloon 1:  \[-----1 to 6-----]
Balloon 2:        \[------2 to 8-------]
Balloon 3:                             \[-----7 to 12-----]

Shoot arrow at position 6 → Burst Balloon 1 & 2
Shoot arrow at position 12 → Burst Balloon 3

````
✅ **Minimum arrows needed = 2**

* **Red (crit)** → Balloon 2
* **Blue (done)** → Balloon 3
* **Black dots** → Arrows fired

## 2. Minimum Number of Platforms Required Problem

### **What is it about?**

You have arrival and departure times of trains at a station.
If two trains are at the station **at the same time**, they need **different platforms**.
The goal is to **find the minimum number of platforms** needed so no train waits.

---

### **ASCII Diagram**

Train 4:                          [11:00---11:30]

At 10:00 → Train 2 & Train 3 present (2 platforms needed)
At 11:00 → Train 2, Train 3, Train 4 present (3 platforms needed)
```

✅ **Minimum platforms needed = 3**

## Main Difference Between the Two Problems

| Feature               | Balloons Blast                                 | Minimum Number of Platforms Required        |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| **What is given?**    | Ranges of balloon positions                    | Arrival & departure times of trains         |
| **What do we find?**  | Minimum number of arrows to burst all balloons | Minimum platforms needed so no train waits  |
| **Logic type**        | Greedy — find overlapping intervals & shoot    | Interval overlap counting (maximum overlap) |
| **Real-life analogy** | Shooting balloons in a carnival                | Managing platforms in a train station       |
| **Key trick**         | Sort by **end position** of balloons           | Sort arrival & departure times separately   |

## Additional Notes — How to Solve Greedy Problems

### **1. Recognizing Greedy Problems**

Greedy problems often have:

* Multiple **intervals** or **events** with start & end points.
* A **choice at each step** that seems best at the moment.
* The **local best choice** also leads to a **global best solution**.

---

### **2. General Greedy Problem-Solving Tips**

1. **Sort first** — Many greedy problems are solved by sorting the input (by start time, end time, or both).
2. **Pick the best possible option at the moment** — For balloons, pick the earliest end position to maximize burst coverage; for platforms, track max overlap.
3. **Track overlaps** — Use counters or compare current intervals with previous ones.
4. **Don’t backtrack** — In greedy problems, once a choice is made, you don’t usually undo it.
5. **Think visually** — Draw intervals on a timeline; overlaps and gaps become clear.

---

### **3. Key Differences in Approach**

| Step           | Balloons Blast                               | Minimum Platforms                     |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| **Sorting**    | Sort by **end position**                     | Sort arrival & departure separately   |
| **Main Check** | Does current balloon start ≤ arrow position? | Is next arrival < earliest departure? |
| **Counting**   | Count arrows used                            | Track max trains present              |
| **Goal**       | Cover all balloons with least arrows         | Find peak overlap count               |

---

### **4. Mindset Shift for Beginners**

* In **Balloons Blast**, you **reuse** a resource (arrow) until it can’t cover the next balloon.
* In **Minimum Platforms**, you **add** resources when needed (more platforms).

Think of it like:

* **Balloons Blast** = Reusing the same umbrella until it no longer covers the next person in line.
* **Minimum Platforms** = Adding more umbrellas when too many people arrive at once.

---

## Generic Greedy Problem Template

You can solve most **interval-based greedy problems** with this 5-step process:

1. **Understand the problem**

   * Identify what’s given (start/end times, ranges, deadlines).
   * Identify what you need to find (minimum resources, maximum events, etc.).

2. **Choose the sorting key**

   * By **end time** → for problems where you want to finish as early as possible (e.g., balloons, activity selection).
   * By **start time** or **event time** → for problems where overlaps matter (e.g., platforms, meeting rooms).

3. **Iterate & apply the greedy choice**

   * Keep track of the last chosen interval/end time/resource.
   * For overlap problems: maintain a counter that increases on start and decreases on end.

4. **Update the answer**

   * If reusing resources: increment count only when the current item cannot be covered by the last choice.
   * If adding resources: track the maximum count reached.

5. **Return the result**

   * For minimum resource problems → return the count of resources used.
   * For maximum selection problems → return the count of chosen intervals.

---

### Example Mapping:

* **Balloons Blast**: Sort by end position → reuse arrow → count arrows.
* **Minimum Platforms**: Sort arrival & departure → track overlaps → max count = answer.

---

## Summary

Both problems deal with **intervals**, but:

* **Balloons Blast**: Cover as many intervals as possible with one shot → Greedy based on **end position**.
* **Minimum Platforms**: Find the maximum overlap → Greedy based on **time events**.
